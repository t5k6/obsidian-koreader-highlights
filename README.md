# Obsidian KoReader Highlights Importer Plugin

This plugin imports highlights from [KoReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes. It scans for `.sdr` directories, parses Lua metadata files, and saves highlights into Markdown files within Obsidian.

## Features
- **Import Highlights**: Import highlights from your KoReader into Obsidian.
- **Scan Highlights**: Scan for highlight files on your KoReader device.
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure the mount point, excluded folders, allowed file types, and highlights folder.
- **Automatic Metadata Handling:** Extracts metadata like author, title, description, pages, and keywords from KoReader's metadata files and adds it as YAML frontmatter to your Obsidian notes.

## Installation
   - Download or clone this repository into your Obsidian vault's plugins. The location of this folder varies by operating system:
       * **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Obsidian\plugins`
       * **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Obsidian/plugins`
       * **Linux:** `~/.config/obsidian/plugins`
